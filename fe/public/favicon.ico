The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that represents the icon displayed in the browser tab. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, I will provide a placeholder comment indicating that this file should contain the favicon image.

Here are the contents for the file:

/Certify/Certify/fe/public/favicon.ico
<!-- This file should contain the favicon image for the application. -->
